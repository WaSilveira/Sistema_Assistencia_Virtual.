# Virtual Assistance System with Speech Interfaces

## Context
This repository originated from a practical learning exercise and was extended to explore the integration of **speech recognition and text-to-speech (TTS)** in a simple virtual assistance system.

The focus is not on advanced NLP models, but on **system integration and usability**, which are critical aspects of applied AI.

## Objective
To build a lightweight virtual assistant capable of:
- Receiving spoken input
- Processing commands in Python
- Returning responses via text-to-speech

## Approach
- Python-based implementation  
- Integration of speech recognition libraries  
- Text-to-speech output for interaction  
- Emphasis on clarity, accessibility, and modular design

## Key Learnings
- Applied AI systems depend as much on integration as on models  
- Usability and clarity are essential for real-world adoption  
- Simple architectures can effectively demonstrate AI concepts  
- Voice interfaces introduce practical constraints and design trade-offs

## Notes
This repository represents applied experimentation with AI interfaces and serves as a complementary artifact to more data- and model-centric projects.
